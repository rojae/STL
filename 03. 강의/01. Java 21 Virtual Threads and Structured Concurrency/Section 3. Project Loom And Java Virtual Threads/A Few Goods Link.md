### Project Loom Wiki

### Project Loom Download Site
- https://jdk.java.net/loom/

The Wiki site contains a lot of links to past talks about Project Loom and it also talks about other related initiatives like Structured Concurrency and Continuations (which we will learn about later in the course). The Download site points to the latest early access JDK build that supports Project Loom.
